# Backtrace JS Release Notes

## [Version 1.0.0](https://github.com/backtrace-labs/backtrace-js/releases/tag/1.0.0)
* `Backtrace-js` now supports tracking individual users by keeping a static identifier across errors and sessions. This will allow you to see how errors are distributed amongst the users and therefore supports priotization of issues based on how many unique users are experiencing them.

## [Version 0.0.12](https://github.com/backtrace-labs/backtrace-js/releases/tag/0.0.12)

* `Backtrace-js` now supports TypeScript. We care about your applications that using Backtrace-js library so we prepared compatible API for you. If you still want to use modern API please use `BacktraceClient` instead.
* `Backtrace-js` options now support sampling and client rate limiting.
    - sampling allows you to drop random reports generated by your application depends on sampling value,
    - client rate limit allows you to set up client limit. By setting this value you will tell library how many reports per minute, client can send to Backtrace
* Modern Promise API is here! `Backtrace-js` allows you to use `async/await` syntax to send reports to Backtrace!
* `reportSync` and `reportAsync` methods now returns `BacktraceResult` object that allows you to understand what happend with report. If you have connection/configuration problems `BacktraceResult` allows you to learn what happend inside library!
